# changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

first public release. the api will change; pin an exact version.

- ops wired into job dags, with serde-typed io and params validated before a run is created
- cron schedules in iana timezones, with pause/resume, tick history, and per-job overlap policy
- assets: content fingerprints make staleness provable, and builds materialize only the stale subgraph
- sensors with persisted cursors; asset probes run on the same loop
- run cancellation, per-op watermark state, and failure hooks (webhook and slack helpers behind the `http` feature)
- http sources: one builder lowers a rest endpoint into fan-out ops with http-aware retries
- sqlite run log with versioned migrations, crash recovery on boot, and optional retention
- embedded web ui: runs timeline, per-op gantt, asset graph, command palette
